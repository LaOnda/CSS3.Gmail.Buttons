#CSS3 Gmail Buttons

CSS3 Gmail Buttons is a collection of button styles inspired by the new Gmail UI.

##How to use

Each button has a base class of <code>class="bttn"</code>. From here, you can add additional classes to emphasise, change colour or to add an icon.

Refer to the <code>index.html</code> for a complete list of examples and their respective classes.

Feel free to use how you like, where you like and when you like. All I ask is that you let me know so I can see what you do with them.
